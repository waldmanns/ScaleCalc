# ScaleCalc
A little tool I use while doing scale modeling in CAD applications. It is meant to stay ready to use atop of the current window, to perform quick calculations.

To use it just enter your values, a calculation is performed at every change/leave event of the fields.


This is really a tiny no-frills program meant to accomplish a single task. C# is not my main programming language nor am I proficient with it. The inputs aren't type protected and try/catches have not been used so far, I may make some robustness improvements in the future.
